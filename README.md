# PROJECT TITLE :  SOUND'S MART

" SOUND'S MART " is my 12th Assignment Project. My project topics name is Headphone. To make this project, I used  React js, Nodejs, Express js, MongoDB, Google Firebase web applications. 

SOUND'S MART is Full Stack based website with user role based. This site's dashboard worked for 3 types of user role - admin, seller and buyer. React js application is easy to use for it's reusable UI components and secure access. I like it very much because of it's handling simplicity, also my site work properly with super fast speed. Also anyone can route easily form one page to another. Link routed properly.

To make this project I faced some challenges to myself and enjoyed it more. Challenges always attracted to Me!
