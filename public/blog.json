        "title" : "What are the different ways to manage a state in a React application?",
        "des" : "There are four main types of state you need to properly manage in your React apps: Local state,Global state,Server state,URL state . Let's cover each of these in detail: Local (UI) state – Local state is data we manage in one or another component. Local state is most often managed in React using the useState hook. For example, local state would be needed to show or hide a modal component or to track values for a form component, such as form submission, when the form is disabled and the values of a form’s inputs. Global (UI) state – Global state is data we manage across multiple components. Global state is necessary when we want to get and update data anywhere in our app, or in multiple components at least. A common example of global state is authenticated user state. If a user is logged into our app, it is necessary to get and change their data throughout our application. Sometimes state we think should be local might become global. Server state – Data that comes from an external server that must be integrated with our UI state. Server state is a simple concept, but can be hard to manage alongside all of our local and global UI state.There are several pieces of state that must be managed every time you fetch or update data from an external server, including loading and error state. Fortunately there are tools such as SWR and React Query that make managing server state much easier. URL state – Data that exists on our URLs, including the pathname and query parameters. URL state is often missing as a category of state, but it is an important one. In many cases, a lot of major parts of our application rely upon accessing URL state. Try to imagine building a blog without being able to fetch a post based off of its slug or id that is located in the URL! There are undoubtedly more pieces of state that we could identify, but these are the major categories worth focusing on for most applications you build."

        "title" : "How does prototypical inheritance work?",
        "des" : "Every object with its methods and properties contains an internal and hidden property known as [[Prototype]]. The Prototypal Inheritance is a feature in javascript used to add methods and properties in objects. It is a method by which an object can inherit the properties and methods of another object. Traditionally, in order to get and set the [[Prototype]] of an object, we use Object.getPrototypeOf and Object.setPrototypeOf. Nowadays, in modern language, it is being set using __proto__ . Syntax: ChildObject.__proto__ = ParentObject. Example In the given example, there are two objects ‘person’ and ‘GFGuser’. The object ‘GFGuser’ inherits the methods and properties of the object ‘person’ and further uses them."

        "title" : "What is a unit test? Why should we write unit tests?",
        "des" : "Unit testing is a type of software testing where individual units or software components are tested. Its purpose is to validate that each unit of code performs as expected. A unit can be anything you want it to be — a line of code, a method, or a class.Generally, smaller tests are better as they give a more granular view of your code’s performance. Also, when you test very small units, your tests can run fast, like a thousand tests in a second fast. We should write unit tests because of to justify any effort in business, there must be a positive impact on the bottom line. Here are a few benefits to writing unit tests: Unit tests save time and money. Usually, we tend to test the happy path more than the unhappy path. If you release such an app without thorough testing, you would have to keep fixing issues raised by your potential users. The time to fix these issues could’ve been used to build new features or optimize the existing system. Bear in mind that fixing bugs without running tests could also introduce new bugs into the system. Well-written unit tests act as documentation for your code. Any developer can quickly look at your tests and know the purpose of your functions. It simplifies the debugging process. Unit testing is an integral part of extreme programming. Extreme programming is basically a “test-everything-that-can-possibly-break” programming strategy. Unit tests make code reuse easier. If you want to reuse existing code in a new project, you can simply migrate both the code and tests to your new project, then run your tests to make sure you have the desired results. Unit testing improves code coverage. A debatable topic is to have 100% code coverage across your application. In the testing pyramid, unit tests are faster than integration and end-to-end. They are more assertive and return quick feedback. "

        "title" : "React vs Angular vs Vue?",
        "des" : "React : React doesn’t enforce a specific project structure,act can be used as a UI library to render elements, without enforcing a specific project structure, and that’s why it’s not strictly a framework.React Elements are the smallest building blocks of React apps. They are more powerful than DOM elements because the React DOM makes sure to update them efficiently whenever something changes.Components are larger building blocks that define independent and reusable pieces to be used throughout the application. They accept inputs called props and produce elements that are then displayed to the user.React is based on JavaScript, but it’s mostly combined with JSX (JavaScript XML), a syntax extension that allows you to create elements that contain HTML and JavaScript at the same time.Anything you create with JSX could also be created with the React JavaScript API, but most developers prefer JSX because it’s more intuitive.Vue: The Vue.js core library focuses on the View layer only. It’s called a progressive framework because you can extend its functionality with official and third-party packages, such as Vue Router or Vuex, to turn it into an actual framework.Although Vue is not strictly associated with the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern, its design was partly inspired by it. With Vue, you’ll be working mostly on the ViewModel layer, to make sure that the application data is processed in a way that allows the framework to render an up-to-date View.Vue’s templating syntax lets you create View components, and it combines familiar HTML with special directives and features. This templating syntax is preferred, even though raw JavaScript and JSX are also supported.Components in Vue are small, self-contained, and can be reused throughout the application. Single File Components (SFCs) with the .vue extension contain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript so that all relevant code resides in one file.SFCs are the recommended way to organize code in Vue.js projects, especially larger ones. Tools such as Webpack or Browserify are required to transpile SFCs into working JavaScript code. Angular: In this article, I’m discussing Angular 2, and not the first version of the framework which is now known as AngularJS.AngularJS, the original framework, is an MVC (Model-View-Controller)) framework. But in Angular 2, there’s no strict association with MV*-patterns as it is also component-based.Projects in Angular are structured into Modules, Components, and Services. Each Angular application has at least one root component and one root module.Each component in Angular contains a Template, a Class that defines the application logic, and MetaData (Decorators). The metadata for a component tells Angular where to find the building blocks that it needs to create and present its view.Angular templates are written in HTML but can also include Angular template syntax with special directives to output reactive data and render multiple elements, among other things.Services in Angular are used by Components to delegate business-logic tasks such as fetching data or validating input. They are a distinct part of Angular applications. While Angular doesn’t enforce their use, it’s highly suggested to structure apps as a set of distinct services that can be reused.Angular is built in TypeScript, so its use is recommended to get the most seamless experience, but plain JavaScript is also supported."
